            Hi everyone! My name is Mehtab Riar and I am currently living in Seattle, Washington. I attended the University of British Columbia for Microbiology and Immunology and I am currently studying at CodeFellows to become a developer. My working experience spans two fields; research in the biological sciences and project management with the latter being the most recent. As far as my goals go I hope to become a full fledged developer and obtain a certificate from CodeFellows by this time in 2023! Thank you for visiting my site and I hope you learned something about me!
